A stockalike Kerbal Space Program mod to add another fuel mixture to the game for (very) partial realism.

This is HEAVILY in Dev, more mod support will come soon! Until I accumulate enough support, this will remain in beta.

FAQ:\
Q: It's not right! [x] doesn't burn AZ50/NTO!\
A: Shoo. Back to RO with you.\
Q: Does this need RealFuels?\
A: Nope.\
Q: How do I request compatibility for stuff?\
A: Raise an issue, ping me on the forums @Clamp-o-Tron, or make a pull request if you've done it yourself! There's a guide in the package if you want to do that and don't know how.\
Q: Is this compatible with KSP version x.x.x?\
A: It won't work with KSP2 (yet), but any KSP1 version with a working Module Manager and B9 Part Switch should be just fine!\

Q: How do I download?\
A: We're still in beta, so you'll have to grab a prerelease from GitHub instead of Spacedock.
