# KSP-Stockalike-Hypergols

A stockalike Kerbal Space Program mod to add another fuel mixture to the game for (very) partial realism.\
This is designed for use with stockalike mods like Bluedog Design Bureau and Tantares.

QIIWBFAQBNHSTY:\
Q: Why are these all AZ50/NTO?\
A: Simplicity. We don't need to go all RealFuels, this is STOCKALIKE hypergols.\
Q: It's not right! [x] doesn't burn AZ50/NTO!\
A: Shoo. Back to RO with you.\
Q: Does this need RealFuels?\
A: Nope.\
Q: How do I request compatibility for stuff?\
A: Raise an issue, ping me on the forums @Clamp-o-Tron, or make a pull request if you've done it yourself! There's a guide in the package if you want to do that and don't know how.\
Q: You messed up a .cfg, made a typo, made an engine hypergolic when it shouldn't be, etc.\
A: Oops! I am a very fallible human. Contact me with the info in the same way as above.\
Q: How do I download?\
A: Spacedock link and forum link incoming. Check for releases here too!\
Q: Why doesn't this affect monoprop engines?\
A: I'm assuming those are meant to just be hydrazine engines.\
Q: Is this compatible with KSP version x.x.x?\
A: It won't work with KSP2 (yet), but any KSP1 version with a working Module Manager and B9 Part Switch should be just fine!\
Q: What in the heck does QIIWBFAQBNHSTY mean?\
A: Questions I Imagine Would Be Frequently Asked Questions But Nobody Has Said These Yet.
